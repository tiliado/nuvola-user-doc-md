Title: Activate Nuvola Apps

In order to use the full version of the genuine flatpak builds of Nuvola Apps, the activation is necessary after
a free trial period. Prior to the activation, make sure that the basic functionality works without any issues. Then
follow a few simple steps:

 1. Click the *Purchase Nuvola* button to open Activation pop over.
 2. Click the *Get a plan* button and
   [Patreon web page of the Nuvola Apps project](https://www.patreon.com/nuvolaplayer)
    will be opened for you to obtain a suitable plan according to your needs.
 3. Once you select a Patreon plan and your first payment goes through, click the *I already have a plan* button.
 4. Create a Tiliado account, which will be later used to check your memberships. Tiliado is an umbrella organization
    behind Nuvola Apps project.
 5. Once you create the Tiliado account and verify your email, click the *I already have Tiliado account* button.
 6. Unfortunately, **Nuvola does not have a direct access to your Patreon account**. For that reason, a Nuvola developer
    will contact you on Patreon (usually within a few hours but sometimes within two business days) to **link your
    Tiliado account with Patreon**. Until this process is done, click the *Later* button to close the dialog for now.
 7. Once the Nuvola developer sends you a message that the accounts have been linked, click the *Activate Nuvola*
    button to link Nuvola with your Tiliado account.
 8. An activation web page will be opened in your web browser to finish the procedure. If no web page is opened,
   please contact [Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).
 9. Enjoy Nuvola Apps!
