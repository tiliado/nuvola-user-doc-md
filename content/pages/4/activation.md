Title: Activate Nuvola Apps

Chances are that you opened this page by clicking on the *Help* button from the activation popover inside Nuvola
application. In that case, **the version of Nuvola installed on your system is rather old** and needs to be updated.
The purchase & activation flow has changed since then and is easier then before.

  1. Update Nuvola flatpaks to the latest version. You can use GNOME/Ubuntu Software Center (3.22 or later) with
     the Flatpak plugin or you can use these two commands:

         flatpak update --user
         flatpak update --system

  2. [Purchase Nuvola](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/pricing/) unless you have already done so. You will receive a license
     key from Gumroad. (A Tiliado account is no longer necessary for new purchases.)
  3. [Follow the new activation instructions](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/docs/4/activation/).
