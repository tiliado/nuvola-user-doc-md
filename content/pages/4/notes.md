About Nuvola Apps
=================

**Nuvola Apps** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

What's New
==========

Nuvola 4 is constantly evolving, to **stay in touch**

### New Features

  * Nuvola Apps Runtime supports **the integration of a progress bar and volume management**. Web app scripts
    which use this feature can not only provide track length & position and current volume but also allow
    a user to change that remotely, e.g. from
    [Media Player GNOME Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/).
    At present, only Deezer
    and Google Play Music scripts use these features, but others will follow.
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#22](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/22) Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#155](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/155)
  * If Nuvola Apps Runtime detects **a Nvidia graphics card**, it checks whether the flatpak extension with 
    corresponding graphics driver is installed. If it isn't, e.g. because of a bug in GNOME Software,
    an error message is shown to provide the user with installation instructions. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#342](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/342)
  * After a lot of effort, a workaround for **the instability of Flash plugin** was found out and is used until
    WebKitGTK developers find a proper fix. However, it is applied only in flatpak builds because it may have
    a negative impact on other WebKitGTK applications otherwise. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#354](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/354)

### Bug fixes

  * A wrong command in desktop launcher was fixed. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#348](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/348)
  * Fix wscript for non-git builds. Issue: [tiliado/diorite#16](https://github.com/tiliado/diorite/issues/16)

### News for Script Maintainers

  * `Nuvola.VERSION_MICRO` contains micro version of Nuvola Runtime.
  * `Nuvola.API_VERSION_MAJOR` and `Nuvola.API_VERSION_MINOR` are now deprecated aliases of `Nuvola.VERSION_MAJOR`
    and `Nuvola.VERSION_MINOR`.
  * [The tutorial](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/tutorial.html) was updated to use Nuvola ADK 4.4.
  * Added documentation of [web app requirement flags](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/tutorial.html#web-technologies).

  * New API for progress bar integration.
  * New API for volume management integration.
  * New utility functions `Nuvola.encodeVersion` and `Nuvola.checkVersion`.
  * `Nuvola.triggerMouseEvent` and `clickOnElement` support relative x & y coordinates, which is useful for clicking on
    a progress bar or a volume bar.

### Under the Hood

  * **New dependencies:** libdrm >= 2.2 and libdri2 >= 1.0
  * Nuvola checks whether VDPAU and VA-API drivers are installed and prints debugging information to console.
    **It will show error dialog in the future though, so make sure the drivers are installed.**
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#280](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/280)
  * Internal icon loading code was refactored. Legacy icon.png and nuvolaplayer3_XXX icons are no longer supported.
    eu.tiliado.NuvolaAppXxx is used everywhere. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#353](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/353)

### New Features

  * Tray icon feature can now use AppIndicator library instead of obsolete X11 tray icons. Although app indicators
    are mostly known from Ubuntu's Unity desktop, they also work in elementaryOS and GNOME Shell (with
    [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support)) and provide
    superior user experience. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#45](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/45)
  * Users can easily clear cookies, cache and temporary files, IndexedDB and WebSQL databases and local storage
    from the Preferences dialog â†’ tab Website Data. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#331](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/331)

### Enhancements

    as Nuvola 5.0.
  * Nuvola can do its own user agent quirks (i.e. to disguise itself as a different web browser) in order to work
    around web pages that doesn't work with the WebKit's user agent string. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/336)
  * Flatpak builds use the latest stable WebKitGTK+ 2.16.3 bringing fixes for three security vulnerabilities as well as
    several crashes and rendering issues.

### Web App Scripts

  * Google Play Music script uses own user agent quirks to work around the malfunctioning Google sign-in web page.
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/336)

### Bug fixes

  * The build script now raises error if it is ran with Python < 3.4.
  * Fixed a bug when the menus of tray icons and dock items were not updated.
  * Nuvola now aborts when required data files are not found (e.g. in incomplete installation) rather they running
    with errors in the background.
  * Obsolete test suite has been removed. A new one will be created during ongoing modernization.
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#335](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/335)
  * Broken -L/--log-file options were removed. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#338](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/338)

    Users' configuration, data and cache is migrated automatically.
  * Nuvola's git repository was moved to https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime.
  * WebKitGTK+ >= 2.16.0 is required as all new API is now used unconditionally to make maintenance easier.
  * Added optional dependency on appindicator3-0.1 >= 0.4. Use `./waf configure --noappindicator` to disable
    this dependency and related functionality (Tray icon feature).
  * Nuvola no longer bundles Engine.io-client JavaScript library but expect version 3.1.0 of it located at the
    JSDIR/engine.io-client/engine.io.js (JSDIR is DATADIR/javascript unless changed with --jsdir).
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#341](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/341)
  * Nuvola no longer supports web app scripts without a desktop file.
  * Test suite was reintroduced (build/run-nuvolaruntime-tests). Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#335](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/335)

### Diorite 4.4.0

    dioriteglib-0.3 â†’ dioriteglib4 and dioritegtk-0.3 â†’ dioritegtk4.
