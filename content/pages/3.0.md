About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user experience and integration with Linux desktop environments
than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome 
common drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

Overall, Nuvola Player is a handy tool that is used by many users around the world. Moreover, some of them love Nuvola Player so much that they
[support further maintenance and development](https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/) of the project.

Minimal Requirements
====================

Although Nuvola Player 3 **officially supports** only three distributions (Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora) and two desktop environments (Unity and GNOME Shell),
it should work on other modern Linux distributions and environments that fulfill following minimal requirements. However, user experience might not be optimal
(e.g. inconsistent look and behavior). Official support for more distributions and environments are expected to be added in the future depending on
[project funding](https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/) and demand from users, especially from donators.
