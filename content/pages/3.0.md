Image: images/3.0/unity/unity_google_play_music_launcher_thumbs_up.png
Description: Nuvola Player 3.0 will be the first release of the third generation of a runtime for
    web-based music streaming services that provides more native user experience and integration
    with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. Nuvola Players handles
    multimedia keys, shows desktop notifications, integrates with various sound indicators, media
    player applets, GNOME lock screen and launchers and more.


About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

Release Notes
=============

Although Nuvola Player 3.0 is currently in development, rolling beta builds are available and are
recommended for general usage. Nuvola Player 3 has been rewritten from scratch and contains plenty
of improvements over Nuvola Player 2, which is no longer maintained. See
[release notes for more information]({filename}3.0/notes.md).

Get Help
========

Whenever you encounter a bug in Nuvola Player, don't hesitate to report it. First of all, it is
necessary to submit your issue to the right place. [Continue to the Get Help page]({filename}3.0/help.md).

Desktop Integration
===================

Goal of Nuvola Player is to provide better
[user experience and desktop integration]({filename}3.0/explore.md) than common web browsers can
offer.

Nuvola Player 3 project officially supports and provides packages for
[Ubuntu]({filename}3.0/install.md#ubuntu) 14.04, 15.04 and 15.10,
[Fedora]({filename}3.0/install.md#fedora) 22-23 and
[Debian]({filename}3.0/install.md#debian) Jessie, Stretch and Sid. The Nuvola Player
developer has tested installation and functionality in clean virtualized instances of these
distributions and can assure reasonable user support in case of problems.

However, Nuvola Player should also work on
[other modern Linux distributions]({filename}3.0/install.md#other-linux), but user experience might
not be optimal (e.g. inconsistent look and behavior) and quality of user support depends on
complexity of an issue.
