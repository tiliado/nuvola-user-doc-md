About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user experience and integration with Linux desktop environments
than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome 
common drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

Overall, Nuvola Player is a handy tool that is used by many users around the world. Moreover, some of them love Nuvola Player so much that they
[support further maintenance and development](https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/) of the project.
