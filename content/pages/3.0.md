About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user experience and integration with Linux desktop environments
than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome 
common drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

Release Notes
=============

Although Nuvola Player 3.0 is currently in development, beta builds are available and are recommended for general usage.
Nuvola Player 3 has been rewritten from scratch and contains plenty of improvements over Nuvola Player 2.
See [release notes for more information]({filename}3.0/notes.md).

Desktop Integration
===================

Goal of Nuvola Player is to provide better [user experience and desktop integration]({filename}3.0/explore.md) than common web
browsers can offer.

Nuvola Player 3 project officially supports and provides packages for [Ubuntu]({filename}3.0/install.md#ubuntu) 14.04-15.04,
[Fedora]({filename}3.0/install.md#fedora) 20-21 and [Debian]({filename}3.0/install.md#debian)
Jessie and Sid. The Nuvola Player developer has tested installation and functionality in clean virtualized instances
of these distributions and can assure reasonable user support in case of problems.

However, Nuvola Player should also work on [other modern Linux distributions]({filename}3.0/install.md#other-linux), but user experience might
not be optimal (e.g. inconsistent look and behavior) and quality of user support depends on complexity of an issue.
