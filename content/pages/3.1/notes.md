About Nuvola Apps
=================

**Nuvola Apps** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

What's New
==========

Nuvola 3.1 is constantly evolving, to **stay in touch**

### New Features

  * Tray icon feature can now use AppIndicator library instead of obsolete X11 tray icons. Although app indicators
    are mostly known from Ubuntu's Unity desktop, they also work in elementaryOS and GNOME Shell (with
    [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support)) and provide
    superior user experience. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#45
  * Users can easily clear cookies, cache and temporary files, IndexedDB and WebSQL databases and local storage
    from the Preferences dialog â†’ tab Website Data. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#331

### Enhancements

  * Nuvola can do its own user agent quirks (i.e. to disguise itself as a different web browser) in order to work
    around web pages that doesn't work with the WebKit's user agent string. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336

### Web App Scripts

  * Google Play Music script uses own user agent quirks to work around the malfunctioning Google sign-in web page.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336

### Bug fixes

  * The build script now raises error if it is ran with Python < 3.4.
  * Fixed a bug when the menus of tray icons and dock items were not updated.
  * Nuvola now aborts when required data files are not found (e.g. in incomplete installation) rather they running
    with errors in the background.
  * Obsolete test suite has been removed. A new one will be created during ongoing modernization.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#335

### Under the Hood

  * WebKitGTK+ >= 2.16.0 is required as all new API is now used unconditionally to make maintenance easier.

    this dependency and related functionality (AppIndicator backend for Tray icon feature).
