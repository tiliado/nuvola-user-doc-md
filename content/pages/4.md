About Nuvola Apps
=================

**Nuvola Apps** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

What's New
==========

Nuvola Apps 4 is constantly evolving, to **stay in touch**
