About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

Nuvola Player 3 project officially supports and provides packages for
[Ubuntu](:3.1/install.html#ubuntu) 14.04, 15.04 and 15.10,
[Fedora](:3.1/install.html#fedora) 22-23 and
[Debian](:3.1/install.html#debian) Jessie, Stretch and Sid. The Nuvola Player
developer has tested installation and functionality in clean virtualized instances of these
distributions and can assure reasonable user support in case of problems.

However, Nuvola Player should also work on
[other modern Linux distributions](:3.1/install.html#other-linux), but user experience might
not be optimal (e.g. inconsistent look and behavior) and quality of user support depends on
complexity of an issue.
