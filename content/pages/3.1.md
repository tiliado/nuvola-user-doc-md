About Nuvola Player
===================

**Nuvola Player** is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It
tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.

What's New
==========

Nuvola Player 3.1 is constantly evolving, to **stay in touch**

have been made and a few new features have been added since then. Key features are introduced bellow,
[see release notes for details](:3.1/notes.html).

[Ability to both display and set track rating in Media Player Indicator GNOME Shell extension](:3.1/explore.html#media-player-indicator-extension)
:   Providing a streaming service supports it, Nuvola Player 3.1 exports track rating in MPRIS
    interface and a custom method to set rating of a track. Note that as of October 30th 2016,
    [Player Indicator git master version](:3.1/explore.html#media-player-indicator-extension) is required.

[HTTP Remote Control interface](:3.1/explore.html#remote-control-over-http)
:   This interface allows creation of client apps to control Nuvola Player over network via an Engine.io socket.

[Media Player Controller web page](:3.1/explore.html#media-player-controller-web-page)
:   This page is an example of a client using the HTTP Remote Control interface. It allows you to control Nuvola Player
    from any device with a web browser (e.g. a phone).
[Nuvola Controller Pebble Watchapp](:3.1/explore.html#nuvola-controller-pebble-watchapp)
:   This app for Pebble watches is another example of a client using the HTTP Remote Control interface. It allows you to control Nuvola Player
    from your wrist.
[Password Manager](:3.1/explore.html#password-manager)
:  With the Password Manager, you can store passwords from login forms in a secure keyring.

Nuvola Player 3 project officially supports and provides packages for
[Ubuntu](:3.1/install.html#ubuntu) 14.04, 15.04, 15.10, 16.04 and 16.10,
[Fedora](:3.1/install.html#fedora) 23-25 and
[Debian](:3.1/install.html#debian) Jessie, Stretch and Sid. The Nuvola Player
developer has tested installation and functionality in clean virtualized instances of these
distributions and can assure reasonable user support in case of problems.

However, Nuvola Player should also work on
[other modern Linux distributions](:3.1/install.html#other-linux), but user experience might
not be optimal (e.g. inconsistent look and behavior) and quality of user support depends on
complexity of an issue.
